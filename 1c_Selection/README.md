## Section 1: R scripts to get walkers
Get ancestry, B values, recombination, and fixed differences for 25kb regions of the genome. 
Repeat for genes. When a gene body is less than 50kb, add 20kb to the total length (10kb before & after)

For ancestry, this and all analyses below are duplicated for `masked` and `unmasked` genomes. 


## Section 2: R scripts to merge walkers
Run with windows of 100kb, 250kb, 500kb, and 1Mb

## Section 3: Selection analyses

## Section 4: Selection analyses differentiating differentially expressed genes
